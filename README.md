# Godot Character Object Model
An object model originally built for an RPG, for use in the Godot Engine. Originally started because I couldn't help myself after talking up a fever in the Discord.

This does not represent a complete Object Model (see the referencing `docs` directory) but contains some stuff that you may find useful when it comes to building your game with the Godot Engine.

## What Can I use this for
Well, if may help you build Entity pawns in your Godot game. I originally started using it for an RPG I am (and still am, on and off) building in Godot. A lot of it is incomplete but I have added documentation where I can to help out.

Do not expect this to be a one-size fit all solution. You will need to refactor some stuff for your project. It may not suit your needs. That being said, I hope it helps you.

If a file still looks like a default gdscript file/has a lot of TODOs, its very likely that I wasn't able to resume development as in the project i'm implementing, I haven't yet gotten to the point where that component needs to be scripted out. I typically don't build out a new Class until I have a need in my project to do so, even if its planned out.
